# File Permissions and ownership

Each file has an Owner, a Group and a set of permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute the file.

## File Permissions

- `r`: read
- `w`: write
- `x`: execute

e.g: `rwxr-xr--` means:
- Owner can read, write, and execute the file
- The group can read and execute
- Others can only read
